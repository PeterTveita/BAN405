In statistical analysis, the presence of outliers (i.e., extreme values) can have a large impact on the results of the estimation and how well the model predicts the observed outcome. Therefore, in this exercise, you will investigate the presence of outliers in the survey data and its effect on the estimates from a linear regression model.\n",

    "- `co2_total`: Total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (Mt CO2e)\n",

    "- `electricity`: Access to electricity (% of population)\n",

    "- `nat_resources`: Total natural resources rents (% of GDP)\n",
    "- `renew_energy`: Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption)\n",
