## Getting Started

To get the assignment files onto your computer, you have two options:

### Option 1: Clone the Repository Using Git

1. **Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/desired/directory
   ```

2. **Clone this repository using Git**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isabelhovdahl/BAN405-H25-assignment2.git
   ```
  
3. **Move into the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd BAN405-H25-assignment2
   ```

You now have a local copy of the full repository — including all files, folders, and version history.

💡 Tip: Later, if updates are made to the assignment, you can pull the latest changes using:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

### Option 2: Download as a ZIP File (No Git Required)

1. Go to the repository page:
👉 https://github.com/isabelhovdahl/BAN405-H25-assignment2

2. Click the green "Code" button at the top right.

3. Select "Download ZIP".

4. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to your desired folder on your computer.
